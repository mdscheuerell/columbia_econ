## Background

The total return of adult salmon of species $i$ in year $t$, $Y^A_{i,t}$, is the sum of natural- and hatchery-origin fish, $N^A_{i,t}$ and $H^A_{i,t}$, respectively, such that

$$
Y^A_{i,t} = N^A_{i,t} + H^A_{i,t}.
$$
Unlike natural-origin fish, the number of hatchery-origin adults in year $t$ $H^A_{i,t}$ is disconnected from the number of hatchery-origin adults in some years prior, and instead is merely the total number of hatchery-origin juveniles released some $k$ years prior $H^J_{i,t-k}$ times their juvenile-to-adult survival,

$$
H^A_{i,t} = \sum_{k = 1}^K s^H_{i,t-k} H^J_{i,t-k}.
$$
